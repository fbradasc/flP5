flP5 1.1.9:
  * Added support for the following defices:
    - PIC16F882, PIC16F883, PIC16F884, PIC16F886, PIC16F887
    Thanks to Edward A. Hildum.

  * Upgraded the building system to support CMake up to the version 2.6.
    Thanks to Edward A. Hildum.

flP5 1.1.8:
  * Fixed reading of the deviceID and deviceIDMask from the defices.prefs
    configuraton file.

flP5 1.1.7:
  * Added support for devices following the  DS39592D programming specification:
    - PIC18F1220, 1320, 2220, 2320, 4220, 4320
    Thanks to Ted Hildum who contributed for this code changes.
  
flP5 1.1.6:
  * Added the autoupdate of the devices.prefs config file
    - the user's devices.prefs will be automatically updated with the 
      new configuration settings

  * Added the following new configuration settings to the GUI:
    - Default value for the configuration words (defaulted to 0xffff)
    - Write buffer size (defaulted to 32)
    - Erase buffer size (defaulted to 64)

flP5 1.1.5:
  * Porting the implementation of Pic18 programming code from odyssey-0.4vasco

flP5 1.1.4:
  * Aligned the PIC programming library to odyssey-0.3.1
    - Added finer-grained signal timing parameters
    - Fix EEPROM data writing & reading for the pic18f252
    - Add initial support for the verification of the PIC device ID

  * New disassembly method, ported from GNU gputils tools.

  * Enhanched the way the PIC memory content is displayed.
    Now the program memory, ID locations, config words and EEPROM area are
    shown in each own sections, 

  * Added the disassembly for the instructions of the Pic18 family.

flP5 1.1.3:
  * The parallel port was only registered but never unregistered, if flP5 is
    started and stopped several times could ends eventually with being unable
    to use a parport device on Linux.

  * The caibration procedure is now started only when:
    - the first time an operation is selected after the execution of flP5
    - a different device or programmer is selected by the combo box
    - it is explicitly executed by the user
      The new "calibration" button and Operation's menu option have been added
      to do this task.

  * Fixed the shortcut invocation for the "Blanck check" operation, it was
    Alt+c, is now Alt+b

  Thanks to Geoff Horn who signaled the parallel port issue and adviced me on
  how to make more user friendly the calibration procedure.

flP5 1.1.2:
  * Aligned the PIC programming library to odyssey-0.3

flP5 1.1.1:
  * Aligned the PIC programming library to odyssey-0.2.3

flP5 1.1.0:
  * Added two new buttons for the On Circuit Test Mode and to simulate the
    hardware reset.

flP5 1.0.1:
  * Upgraded the building system to support CMake up to the current (1.6.7)
    version.  Thanks to Steffen Damelang.

flP5 1.0.0:
  * Initial release.
